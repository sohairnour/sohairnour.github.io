	<h2> ATTENTION EMERGING WEARABLE TECH DESIGNERS: LAST CHANCE TO ENTER DIGITAL MADE 2
</h2>
	<img src="imges/clothing1.jpeg"width="290"height="990"> 
	
	<p> Calling all emerging designers: our friends at Fondazione Mondo Digitale (FMD, or the Digital World Foundation in English) have extended their deadline for the second edition of “Digital Made for Young Fashion Talents.” For those who don’t know, the FMD is a centre in Italy committed to the creation of an inclusive learning society with values of innovation, instruction, and inclusion. They believe in the democratization of technological advancement and innovation and are on a mission to share human knowledge and social inclusion, with  particular orientation to the categories at greatest risk of being excluded (the elderly, immigrants, and unemployed young people.)

	<h2>HACKING THE RUNWAY: HIGH TECH MEETS HIGH FASHION.

	<p> MakeFashion explores the fusion of creativity and fashion with cutting-edge electronics. MakeFashion is an initiative that introduces designers, engineers, and makers to cutting edge new technologies: fusing high-tech and high-fashion on the runway.

Launched in June 2012 by a trio from Calgary, Canada, MakeFashion has produced over 100 wearable tech garments and showcased at over 70 international events. We introduce designers, makers, engineers, and artists to the exciting world of wearables through a series of informative, hands-on, designer-lead workshops.

Our annual runway events in Calgary, Canada debut new collections of innovative fashion technology combined with theatre and performance.


THANKS FOR ANOTHER GREAT SHOW!
We hosted our seventh annual fashiontech runway event on Sept 21, 2019 in Calgary, Alberta. Presented by Calgary Arts Development, in partnership with Beakerhead.
